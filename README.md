Here are some of the notes that I also left on slack.


Here are a few notes on what we have going on....I will also put these in the readme as well.  VERY IMPORTANT, we have limited time essentially in the morning to put this all together.
Tim, you have your "middle section" of page 2.  The sign-up page code that was in here from you is actually a duplicate of the second page.  I cleared that out, and I am building that page tonight.  Your sign-in page that is there you can touch up or whatnot.  So, middle of page 2, and sign in.
Tom-  I know that you started on the "second row", I think has become our moniker for it.  I did not want to intrude on that, since the code is also just avalible to you locally.  You can finish touching those up, and the middle first section that you have.   I wil be on in the morning to try to put it together.  I take the kids to school, so it will be when i get back in.  Any questions, I will do my best to be available to answer.
